## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Speech Recognition**: OpenAI Whisper API
- **Translation**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **Audio Processing**: PyAudio for real-time microphone capture
- **GUI**: Tkinter for simple interface

### Key Features
1. **Bidirectional Translation**: Automatically detects language (Japanese/English) and translates to the other
2. **Real-time Processing**: 6-second audio chunks for optimal balance between speed and accuracy
3. **Noise Filtering**: Ignores common phrases like "Thank you for watching"
4. **Technical Term Dictionary**: Maintains consistency for technical terminology
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: Avoids repeating similar translations

### Language Detection Algorithm
- Uses character-based detection for accurate language identification
- Japanese characters (Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji) presence determines Japanese
- Falls back to English for Latin alphabet text

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel processing for translation while continuing audio capture
- Retry mechanism for API failures (up to 3 attempts)
- Efficient temporary file management
